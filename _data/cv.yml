            - Introducing machine learning based reconstruction algorithm for Electrical Capacitance Tomography
        - title: If you want to know why I have to do research on this unrelated topic as my thesis
          contents:
            - In Iran, academic researches are porfessor-based, so you have to follow professor instructure. So I forced to do this
            - In Iran, the way universities pick students are way different from other countries, I could change my supervisor
            - Supervisors, on the other hand, try to put the most pressure on you to do their projects (which they got paid for that) for free so students dont recieve even a penny)
            - I fought for it, but at last, I was the only person who defeated, all of the rules are agaisnt me
            - I just want to defence my these and apply for some good universities in Europe
