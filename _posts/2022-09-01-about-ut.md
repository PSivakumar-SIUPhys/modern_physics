Hi
In this post I want to tell you a sad story about my student life

I finished my bachelor degree at <a herf="https://tabrizu.ac.ir/">Tabriz University</a> and I have to admite that I'm still happy that I was studing in such a nice university.
After granduation, I took a part in Konkour (massive universities enterance test exam -its unfair somehow, let make long story short) and unbelievably, I got score to get into <a herf="https://ut.ac.ir/">University of Tehran</a> the first and greatest university in Iran.
Lots of dreams, lots of plans....
But I didnt know what will happend and how I will disappointed about this university.
Let me explain something here for you:
<ul>
    <li>In Iran, academic researches are porfessor-based, so you have to follow professor instructure. So I forced to do this</li>
    <li>In Iran, the way universities pick students are way different from other countries, I could change my supervisor</li>
    <li>Supervisors, on the other hand, try to put the most pressure on you to do their projects (which they got paid for that) for free so students dont recieve even a penny)</li>
    <li>I fought for it, but at last, I was the only person who defeated, all of the rules are agaisnt me</li>
</ul>
I just want to defence my these and apply for some good universities in Europe
<hr>
I also looking for some side projects to work on.
